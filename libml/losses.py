  Applies label smoothing such that the on-values are transformed from 1.0 to

  are transformed from 0.0 to `label_smoothing / num_classes`.
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567

  Note that another way of performing label smoothing (which we don't use here)
  is to take `label_smoothing` mass from the on-values and distribute it to the
  off-values; in other words, transform the on-values to `1.0 - label_smoothing`
  and the  off-values to `label_smoothing / (num_classes - 1)`.
